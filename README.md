Muehletech Design Company Website

I began building this static website in March of 2020 after I was laid off due to COVID with the goal of starting my own web development business.  I bought the domain name <i>Muehletech.com</i> and started the web page but put it on hold when I began the application process for a federal government position.  


THIS IS NOT LAUNCH READY CODE
