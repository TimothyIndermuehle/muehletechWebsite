# muehletechdesign-website
I began building this static website in March of 2020 after I was laid off due to COVID with the goal of starting my own web development business.  I bought the domain name <i>Muehletech.com</i> and tarted the web page but put it on hold when I began the application process for the federal government.  

THIS IS NOT LAUNCH READY CODE
